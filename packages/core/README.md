# TODO

`core` will be deprecated in the coming weeks. I plan to gradually move much of this code into
specialized packages so it can be reused in contexts beyond NestJS.

- **Why:** I keep copying and pasting this code across projects
- **Goal:** Installing with `pnpm add ...` should be easier and less error-prone than manually copying and fixing it everywhere
